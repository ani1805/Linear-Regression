Project title: Rental bike demand prediction using Linear Regression
Dataset details: Boom bikes -- Linear Regression

This project aims to solve two problems related to our dataset
1. Firstly, to find out which features are significant in building a predictive linear regression model using Recurrsive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
2. Building a linear regression model with the significant features and further going through the assumptions of linear regression.
